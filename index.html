                            <p>Evening descended gradually into night, yet Bhulo still did not return. Grandpa, as he carried his stick to his usual evening round of cards, scoffed, “No one will steal that mangy stray dog. Just you wait, he’ll come back when he’s hungry.”
                                <br>

Rumu felt a small ache growing gradually on the inside of her throat as she stared at Bhulo’s bread and milk filled plate, lying untouched at the corner of their balcony. It looked pale blue in the evening light, beginning to attract stray ants.
<br>
Bhulo’s collar was tied to the window frame. It looked funny. When someone ties his collar, Bhulo bristles up his fur and neck and ears, and the moment they leave he shrinks and slips out of his collar and runs away.
<br>
Why does he run away?
<br>
Dada was standing near the gate with a chain collar and a short stick in hand, staring across the rail tracks to the other side. He scolded Rumu as he saw her coming towards him. “Go away to your room, what do you want here?”
<br>
“Dada, what if he’s gone to the Santhal village? What if they beat him up?”
<br>
“I hope they do, I’ll be mighty pleased. I’ll show him when he comes home, just let him return first. Now shoo shoo, go away you big crybaby.”
<br>
Rumu went back to their backyard balcony again.
<br>
At this moment Bhulo returned. Not charging in through the front gate as he usually does; but sliding in from the backside across the kitchen, hugging along the wall with his ears flat and tail bogged down, glancing stealthily like a thief as he slobbered down on Rumu’s feet and began to frantically wave his tail. Rumu did not speak, she shivered slightly. In the slight light from the dining room window, she could see it. Bhulo’s pursed lips had a small bit of yellow feather stuck into them, shining golden.
<br>
Rumu’s heart skipped a beat, she frantically ran up to her brother.
<br>
“Dada, there’s a yellow feather stuck to Bhulo’s mouth, just like the one Jhogru told us about.”
<br>
“Shoo, Jhogru made up that entire story about the yellow bird.”
<br>
“No, dada, just come and see.”
<br>
Bhulo was drinking water from his pot. The yellow feather was floating in water, a little wrinkled and wet but still shining as brightly. Bogi picked the feather up, wiped it on his shirt and put it in his pocket.
<br>
No one said a word. The night was soundless, only interrupted by the flapping of wings of night birds above their head, the wind blowing through Tamarisk trees on faraway fallow lands, and the sound of Rumu and Bogi’s own beating hearts. Then this time at least, Jhogru did not lie. Usually he is always making up miraculous stories, mostly about his hometown Dumka. Apparently there is nothing in the world that does not happen in Dumka. When dusk melts into evening and the sun folds up her rays, strange wondrous golden birds descend from the sky there to eat the small red fruits from banyan trees. They don’t sing, they have no voice. They don’t sit on branches, they have no feet. They peck at fruits and then return back to the sky again. But if by chance they hurt their wings and fall to the ground, and if dogs or jackals eat them up, then those dogs and jackals turn into humans. When Jhogru had told them this, Bogi had retorted, “You and your nonsense, Jhogru! How can animals turn into humans?”
<br>
“You may not believe me, Bogi dada, but what do you know of the world? If you did, would the tutor be scolding you every evening? But we have many such men and women in Dumka, you can recognize them at first glance- even though they look like humans, they have strange brick-red eyes and pointy ears. You never see such people here? No one sees those golden birds, but one knows such people and one understands everything.”
<br>
The Pundit’s wife comes by every afternoon to pick up leaves from the Sorrel tree. Sometimes if Rumu is around, she asks Rumu, “Come help me pick leaves. My joints pain, my waist hurts, this is a job for younglings like you.” The sun by then has sunk to tree trunks, the shadows have grown longer. The setting sun light up the Pundit’s wife’s face, her pupils seem strange brick-red, with golden green criss cross marks. Her head covering falls off, she has ears as thin as an oyster shell, ending upwards pointy instead of round.
<br>
Such people are here as well.
<br>
Grandma came and said, “Oh, his lordship has then decided to finally return! Now perhaps finally other people in this house will also eat and study? Your uncle’s back with sweets, go and have some.”
<br>
Rumu went away immediately. Bogi inspected Bhulo’s face, mouth, nose, eyes for some time; but found no difference. He tied Bhulo’s collar as tight as he could and went off.
<br>
While they were preparing for bed, Jhogru absentmindedly remarked to Bogi, “Bhulo didn’t eat anything for dinner. Just laid down on the mat and started snoring.”
<br>
Bogi and Rumu glanced at Jhogru, but said nothing. Jhogru talks too much, who knows if he’ll end up telling grandpa?
<br>
Jhogru continued, “His highness doesn’t like home food, who knows what that little devil swallowed today?”
<br>
Bogi merely said, “Don’t let him off his chains tonight.”
<br>
“What if he starts crying in the night, and grandpa gets angry?” Rumu asked.
<br>
Jhogru finished tying up the mosquito curtain, “A real little devil he is, your doggy. All dogs are chained- but touch this lord, and he’ll whine your head off. Unchain him, and he’ll go off biting everyone.”
<br>
Rumu objected, “But the baker stepped on Bhulo’s tail!”
<br>
“And your grandpa’s friend Animesh? Did he also step on Bhulo’s tail?”
<br>
Bogi was feeling irritated. “Stop sprouting nonsense, Jhogru. He had a black coat on when he came. You know Bhulo dislikes black coats.”
<br>
“Fine, fine, I’ll stop. Just don’t come to me if you are all sent to jail because of your precious dog!”
<br>
After Jhogru left, Bogi lay restless on his bed. Then after a long time had passed, he got up quietly, picked up the torch from the bedside and checked in on Bhulo. Bhulo was snoring happily.
<br>
Relieved, he came back and lied back down. Rumu called him softly, “Brother.”
<br>
“Shut up. Sleep. He’s fine.”
<br>
In the morning, Rumu and Bogi went the backyard balcony while brushing their teeth, only to find that Bhulo’s chain collar was tied to the window, but no Bhulo at the end of it.
